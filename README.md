## SVmodelRcppSMC

## Some more details:
This is an example of an SV model to be estimated via PMMH using RcppSMC in a
as a package. Also, RcppSMC is used to obtain for log-likelihood estimates 
for a standard toy SV model applied to real data or simulated data. A pure R
implementation of Particle Gibbs with and without ancestor sampling for the 
same model is provided too.
