# ## SVmodelPMMH
# 
# This is an example of how to use RcppSMC in a package. I’m not sure whether this example is going to go
# into the paper yet and it’s not fully documented, but it should give you some idea of how to create
# another package that uses RcppSMC. It is fairly basic, using only a single function which is in C++ and no R functions.
# 
# At this stage, you will need to use the Github version of RcppSMC to be able to access RcppSMC.h. After
# we update CRAN (soon), this won't be required.
# 
# ### How to build the package
# You can build the package using
# 
# ```{r, eval = FALSE}
# library('devtools')
# install_github("rcppsmc/rcppsmc")
# Rcpp::compileAttributes("SVmodelPMMH")
# devtools::document("SVmodelPMMH") # if you have Roxygen documentation
# devtools::load_all('SVmodelPMMH')
# devtools::build('SVmodelPMMH')
# ```
# 
# and look at the documentation with `?SVmodelPMMH`. There is some example code in the documentation, but you may wish to reduce `N1` and `N2` to 100 for a quick run.
# 
# ### Using RcppSMC without creating your own package
# 
# If you wanted to use RcppSMC without creating your own package, you can do so using \code{sourceCpp}.
# 
# 
# Simply add the line `//[[Rcpp::depends(RcppSMC)]]` to the top of your C++ file, SMC_Ricker.cpp and replace `library(SVmodelPMMH)` in the example code from the documentation with
# 
# ```{r, eval = FALSE}
# #devtools::install_github("rcppsmc/rcppsmc")
# library(RcppSMC)
# Rcpp::sourceCpp('SMC_Ricker.cpp')
# ```
