\usage{
SMC_Ricker(data, outN, inN, temperatures)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A vector of observed data}

\item{outN}{The number of particles in likelihood annealing SMC (the outer level of SMC)}

\item{inN}{The number of particles to use in the particle filtering run to estimate the likelihood}

\item{temperatures}{The likelihood annealing temperature schedule}
}
\description{
We perform the nested SMC algorithm of Duan and Fulop (2015) on the Ricker
example from Fasiolo et al. (2016).

\details{
Fasiolo et al. (2016) consider completing models for the evolution of a
population over time.

Under one of the models, the population \eqn{N_t} is modelled at time \code{t}
under the discrete time stochastic process
\deqn{N_{t-1} = r N_{t} exp[-N_{t} + z_{t+1}]}
where \eqn{z_t ~ N(0,\sigma^2)}. The true population is observed with error
as \eqn{y_t ~ Pois(\phi N_t)}. We wish to obtain approximate samples from the
posterior distribution for parameters
\eqn{\theta = [log r, log \phi,log \sigma]} and also to estimate
the model evidence so that we can perform model choice (other
models will be added to the package later).

The prior, denoted \eqn{p(\theta)}, for this model is:
\deqn{log r ~ U(2,5)}
\deqn{log \phi ~ U(1.61,3)}
\deqn{log \sigma ~ U(-3,-0.22).}
We can get an unbiased estimate of the likelihood, \eqn{f(y|\theta)} using a
bootstrap particle filter.

We use the method of Duan and Fulop (2015) to obtain approximate samples
from the posterior distribution. We start by drawing an initial population
of \eqn{\theta} from the prior and we traverse the particles through a
series of distributions with targets
\eqn{\pi_t \propto f(y|theta)^{\gamma_t} p(\theta)}, where \eqn{t=0,\ldots,T}
and \eqn{0=\gamma_0 \le \ldots \le \gamma_T = 1}. This is a sequential
Monte Carlo (SMC) method, so we are performing two levels of SMC.
